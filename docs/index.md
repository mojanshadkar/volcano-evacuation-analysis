# Volcano Evacuation Analysis



## Project Overview

This project provides tools for analyzing and visualizing evacuation scenarios from active volcanoes. The analysis pipeline includes:

1. **Data Acquisition** - Download DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and land cover data for the study area
2. **Cost Surface Generation** - Calculate anisotropic cost surfaces based on terrain and land cover
3. **Evacuation Analysis** - Determine optimal evacuation paths and travel times from different locations

## Key Features

- Anisotropic cost calculation considering both terrain slope and land cover
- Multi-directional path analysis (8 cardinal directions)
- Travel time estimation for different walking speeds
- Visualization of evacuation paths and travel times
- Safe zone analysis at different distances from the summit

## Case Studies: Mount Marapi and Mount Awu

The current implementation focuses on Mount Marapi and Mount Awu in Indonesia, demonstrating how the tools can be applied to real-world evacuation planning.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide to begin using these tools for your own volcano evacuation analysis.
